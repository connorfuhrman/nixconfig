# Nix Configuration
Author: Connor Fuhrman

This repository holds the Nix configuraiton for my Mac.
Thus far it is only tested on a MacBook Air using Nix Darwin but the intent it to reuse the `home.nix` for Linux systems as well.

The configuration is somewhat sparse as the intent is to only configure and install the bare minimum here and have a Nix development shell for individual projects.
